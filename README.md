# Problem Statement
The cost of laptops varies widely due to numerous factors such as brand, specifications, and features, making it challenging for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. Retailers and manufacturers also struggle to predict optimal pricing based on changing market trends and product attributes. An accurate and efficient laptop price prediction model is needed to help both consumers and businesses.

# Objectives
1) Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of laptops based on key features like brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, and other specifications.
2) Provide actionable insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify factors influencing laptop prices.
3) Create a robust solution that enables better decision-making for consumers and businesses by offering fair pricing strategies.

# Proposed Solution
1). Data Collection & Preprocessing: Collected a dataset of laptops with features like brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, and price. Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA Conducted EDA to identify patterns and relationships between laptop specifications and their prices, helping to uncover key factors influencing pricing.

3). Feature Engineering Created new features like price-per-GB for storage and price-per-inch for screen size to enhance model performance and better capture pricing trends.

4). Model Building & Evaluation Built and trained regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict laptop prices, evaluating them using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ², and optimizing through hyperparameter tuning.

5). Deployment & Visualization Created visualizations to present insights from the analysis and deployed the model as a web application or API for real-time price predictions, providing actionable data for both consumers and businesses.
